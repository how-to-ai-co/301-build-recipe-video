/**
 * Compositions are GENERATED from configs.mjs. Nothing here is hand-written per
 * ad, so a config entry and a render command cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Composition id:  <Format><number>-<HookStyle>-<OFFER>-<ratio>
 *                  e.g. OneWord431-Tell-FREE-9x16
 *                       Cards403-Tell-FREE-4x5
 *
 * build.sh builds the same string from the same fields.
 *
 * WHY HOOKSTYLE IS IN THE ID. Two arms of one concept can share a number, an
 * offer and a format and differ only in how they open — 401 Ask against 401
 * Tell. Without the hook style in the id they collide and one silently
 * overwrites the other. This is the same reason the delivery filename carries
 * it, and it is what replaced a bare V1/V2 counter that told you two files
 * differed but never what differed.

/**
 * One entry per format. The `format` field in configs.mjs picks the component,
 * lands in the composition id, and lands in the output filename, so the three
 * cannot disagree. Adding a format is one line here plus its component file:
 * the ADS list, build.sh and the naming convention all need no change.
 *
 * Each component brings its own durationOf, because the end-card hold differs
 * per format. Both read FPS from AdRsvp, so the account is 30fps by
 * construction rather than by convention.
 *
 * Keys are the PLAIN-ENGLISH format names the delivery tree uses:
 *   OneWord  one word at a time, voiceover-synced  (RSVP, the Spritz technique)
 *   Cards    your graphics in sequence, voiceover  (captions over artwork)
 *   Aerial   plane footage, text block, silent     (not built yet — parts/40)
